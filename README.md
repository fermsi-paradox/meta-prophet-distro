USING META'S PROPHET FORECASTING ALGORITHM, PROPHET, TO PREDICT BEER SALES IN DISTRO

This is a relatively simple project put together for a data science course a really long time ago. Still cool though! It trains and creates 3 separate Meta Prophet algorithms, in order to train and predict beer volume of a single product algorithm (the 4th) more accurately.

The 3 separate proxy algorithms were trained on soda volume, overall beer industry volume, and weather.  These algorithms then forecast out in the future prior to the final/4th volume algorithm.

The training set was pulled from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utathya/future-volume-prediction?select=train_OwBvO8W)
